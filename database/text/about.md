## About
Our aim is to increase the visibility of People of Color in the field of wildlife ecology and to begin facilitating a conversation on how to expand representation. This database is the first iteration in a larger project to do so. Our group began as a collection of students, postdocs, and faculty committed to highlighting the valuable work and contributions made by People of Color to the broad field of wildlife ecology. Racial and ethnic diversity has and continues to be under-represented within our discipline. We hope this self-nominated database platform can be used to inform the creation of more diverse syllabi and facilitate networking and mentorship opportunities.
